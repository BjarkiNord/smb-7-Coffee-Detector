The dataset includes 1623 images.
Coffee-nocoffee are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 30 percent of the image
* Random rotation of between -15 and +15 degrees
* Random shear of between -14° to +14° horizontally and -12° to +12° vertically
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.6 percent of pixels
